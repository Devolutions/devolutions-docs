# Devolutions Gateway

Devolutions Gateway is the relay server used in Wayk Bastion for peer-to-peer connectivity between Wayk Client and Wayk Agent when a direct connection is not possible.

>[!WARNING]
> "Devolutions Gateway" used to be "Devolutions Jet", and managed with the old `WaykDen` PowerShell module. We are in the process of updating the documentation for the new `DevolutionsGateway` PowerShell module.

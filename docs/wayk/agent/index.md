# Wayk Agent Overview

Wayk Agent is the program meant to allow remote control to a machine managed by Wayk Bastion. The system service from Wayk Agent maintains a persistent link with Wayk Bastion to report its state and expose remote desktop connectivity to technicians using Wayk Client. Wayk Agent requires no separate license and should be deployed on all machines meant to be managed by Wayk Bastion.

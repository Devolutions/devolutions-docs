**Made for Managed Service Providers**

Managed Service Providers (MSPs) have to manage servers for their customers in addition to supporting users when they have an issue with their computer. The Wayk Bastion centralized, uniform approach to remote access management provides the critical response time needed when it has to work instantly.

## What is Wayk Bastion?

Wayk Bastion is a self-hosted remote access management server for machines running Wayk Agent. All remote desktop connections made by technicians using Wayk Client are authorized and monitored with corresponding session audit trails. Allowing remote access is one thing, but keep track of who accessed what, when and for how long is just as important for security.

## Zero Trust Security Freedom

Devolutions Gateway relay servers configured with Wayk Bastion ensure independence from third-party cloud services while providing greater control on data traffic. Both Wayk Agent and Wayk Client use outbound connectivity to Wayk Bastion, such that no VPN or inbound traffic firewall exception is required. The Wayk Bastion zero trust approach to security simplifies remote access because the network location no longer matters.

## Wayk Agent

Wayk Agent is installed on all machines managed by Wayk Bastion. The system service from Wayk Agent reports its state to Wayk Bastion and exposes remote desktop connectivity to technicians using Wayk Client. Wayk Agent deployment can be automated at large scale with machine registration to Wayk Bastion.

## Wayk Licensing

Technicians require an assigned Wayk Bastion Client Access License (CAL). Wayk Bastion CALs are assigned to individual users, such that 10 Wayk Bastion CALs are needed for 10 technicians. While Wayk Bastion CALs can be reassigned as needed, they are not considered "floating" or "concurrent" as seen elsewhere.

A Wayk Bastion CAL unlocks all advanced features for a given user, including unlimited concurrent sessions. For a large number of technicians, unlimited user licensing is the recommended option. As for Wayk Agent, it does not require a license, regardless of the number of machines.

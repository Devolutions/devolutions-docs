**Made for Managed Service Providers**

Managed Service Providers (MSPs) have to manage servers for their customers in addition to supporting users when they have an issue with their computer. The Wayk Bastion centralized, uniform approach to remote access management provides the critical response time needed when it has to work instantly.

**What is Wayk Bastion?**

Wayk Bastion is a self-hosted remote access management server for machines running Wayk Agent. All remote desktop connections made by technicians using Wayk Client are authorized and monitored with corresponding session audit trails. Allowing remote access is one thing, but keep track of who accessed what, when and for how long is just as important for security.

**Zero Trust Security Freedom**

Devolutions Gateway relay servers configured with Wayk Bastion ensure independence from third-party cloud services while providing greater control on data traffic. Both Wayk Agent and Wayk Client use outbound connectivity to Wayk Bastion, such that no VPN or inbound traffic firewall exception is required. The Wayk Bastion zero trust approach to security simplifies remote access because the network location no longer matters.

Wayk Client is used by technicians to establish remote desktop connections to machines managed by Wayk Bastion. Wayk Agent needs to be installed on the target machine and connected to the same Wayk Bastion. Each technician using Wayk Client requires an assigned user license in Wayk Bastion.
